### Or if you're feeling bold, you can clone OR download a local instance of the site:

* Clone
  * Open your terminal program
    * On a Mac, this would be in the Applications/Utilities directory, and is called, "Terminal"
    * Windows uses a Terminal program as well, but a Terminal with all the capabilities we'll require is not installed by default. Thankfully, we can easily download and install a Terminal program that does fit our needs.
There are many options available, but we recommend using a terminal program called git bash. You can download this free program at [msysgit.github.io](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).
